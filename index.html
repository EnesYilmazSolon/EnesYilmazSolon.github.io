  <h4>Kitchen Part: I</h4>
  
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a super cool kitchen in a school. The kitchen was equipped with all the latest appliances and gadgets that made cooking and cleaning a breeze. The walls were painted in bright colors, and the cabinets were made of polished wood. The kitchen had a large island in the center, which was used for preparing food. There were pots and pans of all sizes hanging from the ceiling, and the shelves were stocked with all kinds of ingredients. The students loved coming to the kitchen to cook and experiment with new recipes. </p>
